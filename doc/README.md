# Blood Pressure Monitor Lib Algorithm

Based on array of integers and a point of interest the algorithm perform these steps:

## Preprocessing
* Step #1 - Find all peaks in the array 

A peek is represented by the `value of prev x >= value of x > value of next x`.
The test is `prev x >= value` because the target is the closest index.
The algorithm runs from 0 index to the length of the array.
All peaks are appended to vector for later use.

* Step #2 - Find trough in array before peak

A trough is represented by the `value of prev y <= value of y > value of next y`.
The test is `prev x <= value` because the target is the closest index.
The algorithm is run from the peak to 0 and stop if trough found.
All trough is appended to vector for later use.

* Step #3 - Calculate the distance (in points) between peak and trough
When the index of peaks and trough associated its possible to calculation distance peak to trough from all. The distance help to determine the high (valid area to measure) / low (dicrotic notch) waves.

* Step #4 - Discard distance = 0
All distance zero is a low wave (dicrotic notch). 

* Step #5 - Done vector of *struct* peak/trough/distance values.

## Measure
The measure consists in verifying if `index-1` is among one of waves valid. If found display the results like `SBP = peak + 1` and `DBP = trough + 1`. Then `+1` is necessary because the search point from the user start in 1, not 0 (vector default).

## Extra
To estimate the heart rate from peaks in BPM, take the sample rate of 8ms = 125 Hz, multiply to the distance from two peaks and divide per 60. The value is rounded before return.

## Analysis
All initial analysis and tests of problem has done in Python.
